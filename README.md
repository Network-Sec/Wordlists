# Wordlists

Some unique lists, most are made for Pentesting, some for fun and informative purposes, like "server_headers.txt".

Most of our customlists are too large to upload on GitHub, we tried to compensate and instead help with some `Python` scripts that generate lists for you. There's already so many wordlists out there, including well-made collections such as seclists, or huge lists like **crackstation** and **hashes.org**.

We'll soon add a blog article on this topic and link it here, covering state-of-the-art tools and techniques, including how to capture and crack modern Wifi.
